# MDBenchmark
Input files to evaluate properties of organic solids using molecular simulation.
For the simulations we use [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org) and some Python scripts in this repository.
The scripts are adapted to some of the CPU clusters we have access to, so will need to be adapted
by anyone trying to reproduce parts of this work.

A paper about this work has been submitted for publication.
